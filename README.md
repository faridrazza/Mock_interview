## **AWS Lambda Implementation**

### **Core Lambda Functions:**

Starting with **Standard AI Interview Feature - Complete Breakdown**

**Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. Interview Configuration (`InterviewConfig.tsx`)
   - User selects job role and 
   - User has option to select either fresher or experienced
   - If the user selects "Experienced," they should be prompted to enter their years of experience.
   - Subscription limit checking
   - Session storage for configuration

2. Interview Session Initialization (`InterviewSession.tsx`)
   - Database record creation
   - Timer start
   - 3D Avatar setup
   - First question generation (Aws lamda)

3. AI Question Generation **(AWS LAMDA)** 
   - OpenAI GPT-4 integration
   - Experience-level adaptive prompts
   - Context-aware conversation flow
   - Fallback system for reliability

4. Text-to-Speech with Lip-Sync **(AWS LAMDA)**
   - **Amazon Polly** neural voice synthesis
   - Advanced phonetic lip-sync generation
   - Rhubarb mouth shape mapping (A-H, X)
   - Timing synchronization

5. 3D Avatar Rendering (`Avatar3D.tsx`)
   - Three.js/React Three Fiber
   - 3D Avatar glb.file and animation file
   - Real-time mouth shape application
   - 60 FPS smooth animation
   - Performance-optimized facial mesh updates

6. User Response Handling Converting Speech to Text **(AWS LAMDA)**
   - Voice input via OpenAI Whisper
   - Text input processing
   - Message state management

7. Conversation Flow Management 
   - Storing conversation history for better context and feedback generation
   - AI thinking states
   - Message threading

8. Interview Feedback Generation **(AWS LAMDA)**
   - Multi-dimensional scoring (communication, technical, clarity)
   - Actionable insights (Areas of improvemnt)

## **Lip-Sync Technology Explained**

### **How It Works:**
1. **Phonetic Analysis**: Text is broken down into speech sounds (phonemes)
2. **Rhubarb Mapping**: Each phoneme maps to one of 9 mouth shapes:
   - **A**: Open mouth (vowels like "father")
   - **B**: Closed mouth (consonants like "b", "m", "p")
   - **C**: Wide mouth (vowels like "bite")
   - **D**: Round mouth (vowels like "go")
   - **E**: Small mouth (vowels like "bed")
   - **F**: Bottom lip to teeth ("f", "v" sounds)
   - **G**: Teeth touching ("t", "d", "s", "z")
   - **H**: Tongue visible ("th", "l")
   - **X**: Neutral/silence

3. **Timing Calculation**: Synchronizes mouth shapes with audio duration
4. **Real-time Application**: Updates 3D model morph targets at 60 FPS
5. **Smooth Transitions**: Interpolates between shapes for natural movement

### **Technical Stack Used:**
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for all AI processing
- **Amazon Polly**: Neural text-to-speech synthesis
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: Advanced question generation and feedback
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription

**How ATS Score Flow Works:**

When a user uploads their resume (PDF or DOCX) through the PublicResumeUploader component, the following process is triggered:

**Resume Parsing:**
The file is sent to the resume parsing function to extract structured information.

**ATS Analysis:**
The parsed data is passed to the ATS analysis service, which evaluates the resume and returns:
- An AI-generated ATS score
- Suggestions for improvement

**Resume Preview:**
The system then displays a preview of how the resume would look in one of our custom templates.

**Continue to Edit:**
If the user clicks the "Continue to Edit" button:
- If logged in, they are redirected to the dashboard and taken to the Modern Resume Editor.
- If not logged in, they are prompted to log in or sign up first.

**Editing & Enhancement (Modern Resume Editor):**
Users can edit resume content, switch templates, and use the "Enhance with AI" feature, which calls an AWS Lambda function to generate improved content.

**Final Output:**
Once editing is done, users can preview and download the resume in PDF format.
